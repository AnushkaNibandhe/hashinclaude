## 1. Project Overview

FixMyCity is a civic issue management system that connects three stakeholders:

- **Municipal Authorities** — create and manage civic issues (potholes, broken lights, drainage problems, etc.), assign contractors, and monitor resolution on a live map.
- **Contractors** — discover open jobs on a map, place competitive bids, and submit GPS-verified completion proof with photos.
- **Citizens** (future) — report issues directly via a mobile/web app. The backend is already structured to accept citizen data without any code changes.

The system is designed around a **source-agnostic data pipeline**: whether a job is created by an authority or a citizen, it flows through the exact same backend logic. This means the Citizen App can be integrated later with zero backend changes.

### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Single shared backend | Both dashboards and the Citizen App hit the same API — no separate BFF layers |
| Source-agnostic job pipeline | The `source` field on Job is stored but never branched on in controller logic |
| Cloudinary for media | Images are streamed from multer memory storage directly to Cloudinary — nothing written to disk |
| JWT authentication | All routes except `/api/auth/*` require a valid Bearer token; role is embedded in the token |
| 30-second live polling | Both dashboards use `setInterval`-based polling — keeps the backend stateless, no WebSockets needed |

---

## 4. Applications

### 4.1 Authority Dashboard

The web portal used by municipal authorities. It acts as the **temporary issue creator** while the Citizen App is not yet integrated.

**Pages:**
- `/` — Landing page
- `/login`, `/signup` — Authority authentication
- `/dashboard` — Live analytics overview (stat cards + severity distribution)
- `/jobs` — Kanban board for all jobs across all statuses
- `/complaints` — Complaint management
- `/map` — Full-screen interactive map with all job markers

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create civic issues via a full form (title, description, category, severity, image, GPS/map location)
- View all jobs in a Kanban board (OPEN → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
- Review contractor bids for each open job
- Assign a contractor to a job (accepts winning bid, auto-rejects all others)
- View completion proof (photo + GPS location) on the map
- One-click demo job creation from preset templates
- Live analytics: total issues, active hotspots, completed issues, severity breakdown

### 4.2 Contractor Dashboard

The web portal used by contractors to find and complete work.

**Pages:**
- `/contractor/login`, `/contractor/signup` — Contractor authentication
- `/contractor/app/` — Contractor dashboard with personal stats
- `/contractor/app/jobs` — Browse all open jobs available for bidding
- `/contractor/app/bids` — View submitted bids and their statuses
- `/contractor/app/my-jobs` — Jobs assigned to this contractor
- `/contractor/app/map` — Interactive map showing open jobs with bid popup
- `/contractor/app/profile` — Contractor profile and reputation ring

**Key Capabilities:**
- Discover open jobs on an interactive map
- Click a map marker to see job details and place a bid directly from the popup
- Submit bids with ETA, cost estimate, and notes
- Mark assigned jobs as complete with GPS capture and photo proof
- Track bid statuses (PENDING / ACCEPTED / REJECTED)

### 4.3 Citizen App 

```Write Description```

---

## 5. Core Workflow

```
1. Authority creates a civic issue
        │
        ▼
2. Job appears on the map (status: OPEN)
        │
        ▼
3. Contractors view the job on their map
        │
        ▼
4. Contractor places a bid (ETA + cost + note)
        │
        ▼
5. Authority reviews bids and assigns one contractor
   → Winning bid: ACCEPTED
   → All other bids: REJECTED
   → Job status: ASSIGNED
        │
        ▼
6. Contractor works on the job
   → Job status: IN_PROGRESS
        │
        ▼
7. Contractor submits completion proof
   → Uploads photo
   → Captures GPS coordinates
   → Job status: COMPLETED
        │
        ▼
8. Map updates: completion marker + dashed line to original location
   Authority can view proof photo in popup
```

## 6. Features

### Issue Creation
- Full form with title, description, category (POTHOLE, ELECTRICAL, DRAINAGE, FOOTPATH, WATER, OTHER), and severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- Image upload with live preview (PNG, JPG, WEBP)
- GPS capture via browser geolocation API (`enableHighAccuracy: true`)
- Embedded map picker (centered on Pune: `[18.5204, 73.8567]`) for click/drag pin placement
- Coordinates displayed as text overlay on the map picker
- Validation blocks submission if title, description, or location is missing

### Interactive Map
- Leaflet-based map on both dashboards
- Severity-based color-coded markers: HIGH → red (`#EF4444`), MEDIUM → yellow (`#F59E0B`), LOW → green (`#10B981`)
- Completed jobs always render green regardless of severity
- HIGH severity jobs (not completed) have a CSS pulse animation
- Marker clustering via `leaflet.markercluster` with count badges
- Severity legend on the map
- 30-second live polling for real-time updates
- Completion markers (checkmark icon) at contractor GPS location
- Dashed green polyline connecting original job location to completion location
- Popup on completion marker shows "Resolution Proof" + photo thumbnail

### Map Popups
- Click any marker to see: job title, description (truncated to 80 chars), severity badge, status badge, image thumbnail
- Dark-themed popups (`#1a1a1a` background, white text)
- Contractor map popup includes a "Place Bid" button

### Analytics Dashboard
- Total Issues count
- Active Hotspots (non-completed jobs)
- Completed Issues count
- Severity Distribution (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW counts)
- All derived from live API data — no hardcoded values

### Bid System
- Contractors submit bids with ETA, cost, and optional notes
- Authority sees all bids per job with contractor username
- One-click assignment: accepts winner, rejects all others atomically
- Bid status tracking: PENDING → ACCEPTED or REJECTED

### Job Completion with Proof
- GPS capture required (blocks submission if denied)
- Photo upload to Cloudinary
- Completion location, image, timestamp, and verification flag all persisted
- Completion visualized on authority map

### Demo Mode
- 5 built-in preset job templates (realistic civic issues)
- One-click demo job creation from the Create Job modal
- Demo jobs tagged with `isDemoJob: true` and a "demo" badge in the UI
- Random preset selection if no index specified

### Status Badges & UI Feedback
- Status badges for all four job states: OPEN, ASSIGNED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
- `isVerified: true` → "VERIFIED ✅" indicator
- `isVerifiedCompletion: true` → "COMPLETION VERIFIED ✅" indicator
- Loading states during API fetches
- Error banners on API failure (no page crashes)

---

## 9. Authentication & Security

- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** with 10 salt rounds before storage
- JWT tokens are signed with `JWT_SECRET` and expire per `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` config
- Token payload contains `{ id, role }` — role is used for route-level access control
- All non-auth routes are protected by the `authMiddleware` which:
  1. Extracts the Bearer token from the `Authorization` header
  2. Verifies it with `JWT_SECRET`
  3. Attaches the decoded payload to `req.user`
  4. Returns HTTP 401 on missing or invalid token
- Three user roles: `ADMIN` (authority), `CONTRACTOR`, `CITIZEN` (future)

---

## 10. Map System

Both dashboards use **Leaflet** with **React Leaflet** for interactive maps.

### Marker Color System
```
Severity HIGH   + not COMPLETED  →  #EF4444  (red)
Severity MEDIUM + not COMPLETED  →  #F59E0B  (yellow)
Severity LOW    + not COMPLETED  →  #10B981  (green)
Any severity    + COMPLETED      →  #10B981  (green, always)
```

### Map Features
- **Hotspot Markers** — colored `divIcon` markers per job
- **Pulse Animation** — HIGH severity non-completed jobs pulse with CSS animation
- **Marker Clustering** — `leaflet.markercluster` groups nearby markers with count badges
- **Completion Markers** — checkmark-style icon at contractor's GPS location
- **Completion Line** — dashed green polyline from original job location to completion location
- **Map Picker** — embedded minimap in the issue creation form for click/drag pin placement
- **Live Polling** — `setInterval` re-fetches every 30 seconds
- **Memory Leak Prevention** — `mapInstance.remove()` called on component unmount
- **Missing Location Guard** — jobs without `location.lat`/`location.lng` are silently skipped

---

## 11. Image Uploads

Images are handled via a two-step process:

1. Client POSTs image to `POST /api/upload` as `multipart/form-data`
2. Backend uses **Multer** with `memoryStorage()` (no disk writes) to buffer the file
3. Buffer is streamed to **Cloudinary** via `upload_stream`
4. Cloudinary returns a secure URL which is stored in the Job/Complaint document

This applies to both:
- Issue cover images (uploaded by authority during job creation)
- Completion proof photos (uploaded by contractor during job completion)

---

## 12. Demo Mode

The system includes 5 built-in preset job templates for quick demonstration:

- Accessible via `GET /api/jobs/demo/presets`
- Create a specific preset: `POST /api/jobs/demo` with `{ "preset": 0 }` (index 0–4)
- Create a random preset: `POST /api/jobs/demo` with no body
- Create a custom demo job: `POST /api/jobs/demo` with full payload
- All demo jobs have `isDemoJob: true` and `status: "OPEN"`
- Authority Dashboard shows a "Demo" toggle in the Create Job modal
- Demo jobs display a "demo" badge in the jobs list

---

## 13. Status Lifecycles

### Job Status
```
OPEN  →  ASSIGNED  →  IN_PROGRESS  →  COMPLETED
```
- `OPEN`: Job created, awaiting bids
- `ASSIGNED`: Authority has selected a contractor
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Contractor has started work
- `COMPLETED`: Contractor submitted proof, work done

### Bid Status
```
PENDING  →  ACCEPTED  (one per job, max)
         →  REJECTED  (all others when a bid is accepted)
```

### Complaint Status (synced with linked Job)
```
RECEIVED  →  JOB_CREATED  →  IN_PROGRESS  →  COMPLETED
```
When a Job has a `complaintId`, the linked Complaint's status is automatically updated in the same request handler whenever the Job status changes.

# Configure .env with your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and Cloudinary credentials
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd fixmycity-authority-portal-main/FixMyCity-authority-portal-main
npm install
npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Frontend tests
cd fixmycity-authority-portal-main/FixMyCity-authority-portal-main
npm test
```

### First-Time Setup
1. Start the backend server
2. Register an ADMIN user via `POST /api/auth/signup` with `role: "ADMIN"`
3. Register a CONTRACTOR user via `POST /api/auth/signup` with `role: "CONTRACTOR"`
4. Log in to the Authority Dashboard at `/login`
5. Create a job using the "Create Issue" button
6. Log in to the Contractor Dashboard at `/contractor/login`
7. Find the job on the map and place a bid
8. Back in the Authority Dashboard, assign the bid
9. In the Contractor Dashboard, mark the job complete with GPS + photo proof

## Key Design Principles

- **Future-ready**: The backend is designed so the Citizen App can be integrated without any changes to existing controller logic. The `source` field is stored but never branched on.
- **Source-agnostic**: `POST /api/jobs` accepts any `source` value and processes all jobs identically.
- **Stateless backend**: 30-second polling instead of WebSockets keeps the API stateless and horizontally scalable.
- **No disk writes**: All images go directly from memory to Cloudinary — the server never writes files to disk.
- **Graceful degradation**: Missing location data, API failures, and GPS denial are all handled without crashing the UI.
- **Property-based testing**: Core invariants (bid exclusivity, status sync, color mapping, analytics derivation) are verified with 100+ randomized iterations using fast-check.
